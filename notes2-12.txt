Apache - httpd - lifespan isn't long, waits for connection to come along
problem: lots of connections at the same time will overwhelm your server with httpd's and not respond well.
solution1: farm requests to Apache servers - send it off.

new solution: 

- chrome takes in the HTML
- digests it - loads into DOM (CSS is there too)
- Javascript loaded separately by Chrome into [V8 Engine]
	asynchronous - like AJAX, fire off the XHR (5 states) waiting to get back to "4".
	non-polling. waits for the response and makes the apprpriate change.

made a server out of a Javascript enginer [V8]
